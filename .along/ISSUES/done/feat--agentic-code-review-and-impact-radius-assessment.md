# Agentic Code Review & Blast Radius Impact Assessment Protocol

## Goal
Establish a mandatory, automated **Agentic Code Review & Impact Radius Assessment** protocol within the system, requiring agents to critically analyze their own code changes before completing non-trivial tasks, assessing blast radius across dependent modules, architecture compliance, and safety.

## Accomplishments
1. **Protocol Integration**:
   - Added mandatory Code Review & Blast Radius assessment guidelines under `## While working` in `AGENTS.md` and `protocol.md`.
   - Updated the **Mandatory Stage & Session Completion Checklist** with item #2:
     - Inspect git diff for unintended side effects, unhandled nulls/errors, and edge cases.
     - Evaluate systemic impact radius on callers/dependents using `code-review-graph` or AST analysis.
     - Verify compliance with architectural decisions in `.along/DECISIONS.md`.
2. **Skill Suite Enforcement**:
   - Updated `skills/along-wrap-session/SKILL.md` and `skills/along-wrap-stage/SKILL.md` to enforce Code Review as a mandatory step in the wrap-up pipeline.
3. **ADR #008 Logged**:
   - Logged architectural decision in `.along/DECISIONS.md`.
